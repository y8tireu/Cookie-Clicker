Here are some "hacks" that you can use in the console of your browser's developer tools (Inspect Element menu) to modify the game's behavior. Open the console (usually accessible by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`, then navigating to the "Console" tab) and type these commands to manipulate the game's state.

### 1. **Add Cookies Instantly**

Add a large number of cookies instantly by running this command. You can change `100000` to any number you want.

```javascript
cookies += 100000;
updateCookieCount();
```

### 2. **Increase Cookies per Second**

Multiply the cookies per second by a certain factor. This will make your cookies generate much faster automatically.

```javascript
cookiesPerSecond *= 10; // Multiply by 10 (change to any number)
```

### 3. **Reduce Cost of Upgrades**

Set the cost of each upgrade (cursor, grandma, farm) to 1 cookie, making them essentially free to buy.

```javascript
cursorCost = 1;
grandmaCost = 1;
farmCost = 1;
updateCookieCount();
```

### 4. **Get Maximum Upgrades Instantly**

Increase the number of cursors, grandmas, and farms instantly by setting them to a high number.

```javascript
cursors += 100;     // Adds 100 cursors
grandmas += 100;    // Adds 100 grandmas
farms += 100;       // Adds 100 farms
cookiesPerSecond += (100 * 0.1) + (100 * 1) + (100 * 5); // Update cookies per second
updateCookieCount();
```

### 5. **Trigger Golden Cookie Anytime**

Spawn a golden cookie instantly by calling this function. The golden cookie will appear on the screen for you to click.

```javascript
spawnGoldenCookie();
```

### 6. **Collect Golden Cookie Rewards Without Clicking**

This command will simulate collecting a golden cookie, giving you the rewards instantly without needing to click it.

```javascript
collectGoldenCookie();
```

### 7. **Set Infinite Cookies per Second**

If you want to generate cookies at an absurdly high rate, set `cookiesPerSecond` to a very high number. This will flood your cookie count very quickly.

```javascript
cookiesPerSecond = 100000; // Set to an extremely high number
updateCookieCount();
```

### 8. **Reset Game Progress**

If you want to reset the game back to its initial state, you can use the following code:

```javascript
cookies = 0;
cursors = 0;
grandmas = 0;
farms = 0;
cursorCost = 15;
grandmaCost = 100;
farmCost = 500;
cookiesPerSecond = 0;
updateCookieCount();
```

### 9. **Auto Clicker for Cookie Button**

Automatically click the cookie button every 100 milliseconds to simulate an auto-clicker.

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  cookies++;
  updateCookieCount();
}, 100);
```

### 10. **Disable Golden Cookie Timer for Constant Appearance**

Make golden cookies appear every 3 seconds for constant rewards.

```javascript
setInterval(spawnGoldenCookie, 3000);
```

### Using the Hacks

To use any of these hacks:
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Open the console (right-click, select "Inspect", go to the "Console" tab).
3. Copy and paste the desired code snippet into the console and press Enter.

Enjoy testing out these cheats! Remember, these modifications are for fun and learning, and they can change the game experience significantly.


Auto Buyer:function autoBuy() {
  if (cookies >= cursorCost) {
    buyUpgrade('cursor');
  }
  if (cookies >= grandmaCost) {
    buyUpgrade('grandma');
  }
  if (cookies >= farmCost) {
    buyUpgrade('farm');
  }
}

// Set an interval to run the autoBuy function every second
setInterval(autoBuy, 1000);
